## SQL_Project_One

## **Introduction**

* In this project, a cleaned and transformed 'bike purchase' dataset that contains information on 'bike purchase by different individuals with discrete attributes' is presented.

* Our aim is to analyze the dataset on MYSQL database management system using the SQL language in order to draw insights that will guide the bike seller in making informed marketing decisons hence improving his bike sales.

## **Purpose of the project**

**1)**. Identify which demographic of our identifiers purchased bikes more compared to their counterparts.

 -This will grant the bike seller insight on which demographic to market more to in order to maximize bike sales.

**2)**. Identify which demographics are underexplored and have a potential to purchase bikes at a high rate.

 -This will guide the bike seller in diverting marketing targets from demographics that are least interested in bike purchase to demographics that have a greater potential to purchase more bikes.
